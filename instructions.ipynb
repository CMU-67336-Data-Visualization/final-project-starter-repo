    "<h2>Coding Advice for the Project</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "- First and foremost, ***START EARLY!!!!!*** Keep in mind that this project has been designed to take most students up to a month to complete sufficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan thoroughly** before touching any code!!! Work with your partner to figure out what components and files need to be completed for each goal/dashboard. This will make it much easier to sit down and code. Coding with a plan is always more efficient!\n",
    "> **Code Planning 101!**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *Ask these questions when planning (in this order):*\n",
    "> 1. What features do I need to address this goal/question?\n",
    "> 2. What are the different parts/components I need to create this feature?\n",
    "> 3. What are the different files I need to create the different parts?\n",
    "> 4. What major functions or other coding structures should I include in each file?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't work on **overlapping/dependent features**. Try to divide the work so that it does not overlap and is independent of each other's progress. Parallel work is key to efficient and rapid progress!\n",
    "> **Overlapping example**: Working on the same page. This is fine if you are each working in a different files, such as creating separate and independent components. We suggest creating a shared file for the report page (as completing this should be a joint effort!) that updates in real time (such as a Google Doc) and delegating updating the repository with the information to one partner.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Dependency example**: Working on a feature dependent on another person's work. If there are two components and one data loader for each component, we suggest splitting up the work such that each person works on one component with its corresponding data loader rather than one person working on the data loaders and the other working on the components. By doing so, neither partner's progress will be hindered or dependent on the other's.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create and push to **separate feature branches**. This keeps your work off the main branch until it is fully ready and gives your partner the chance to review your changes before merging them into the main branch (make pull requests!). This also has the added benefit of allowing you to just delete a branch if it is beyond saving and start anew.\n",
    "> **A Quick Tutorial of Using, Pushing, and Merging Feature Branches!**\n",
    "> 1. Create a feature branch locally with `git checkout -b \"feature-branch-name\"`\n",
    "> 2. When you are ready to push your changes from the feature branch to the remote repository, use `git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch-name`. This will push your changes to the remote version of your feature branch rather than the remote `main` branch.\n",
    "> 3. Go to your feature branch on GitHub (in the remote repository). Under the branch dropdown below the title of your repository, click on your feature branch.\n",
    "> 4. Click on the button that says **\"Compare and pull request\"**.\n",
    "> 5. Now make a pull request and request your partner as a reviewer under Reviewers. Your partner should do a code review before you merge code into the main branch.\n",
    "> 6. Once everything looks good to both you and your partner, click the **\"Merge pull request\"** button in the pull request. This should merge it into main if there are no conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try as much as possible to **work together in person**. Joint coding/debugging sessions in person are much more effective and you will get more done. Setting up an agenda/to-do list to address during work sessions can be very helpful to keep you on track and less distracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Take breaks** and ask your partner for help when debugging. Debugging can take a long time and fresh eyes are much more effective at spotting bugs. That is, take breaks in between coding and debugging to keep your eyes fresh and ask your partner to take a quick glance at your code if you are *really* stuck.\n",
